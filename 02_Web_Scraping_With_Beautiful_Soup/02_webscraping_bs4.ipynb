    "# Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of extracting and storing data from websites for analytical or other purposes. Therefore, it is useful to know the basics of html and css, because you have to identifiy the elements of a webpage you want to scrape. If you want to refresh your knowledge about these elements, check out the [HTML basics notebook](./01_HTML_Basics.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through all the important steps performed during web scraping with python and BeautifulSoup in this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives for this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you should:\n",
    "- be able to look at the structure of a real website\n",
    "- be able to figure out what information is relevant to you and how to find it (Locating Elements)\n",
    "- know how to download the HTML content with BeautifulSoup\n",
    "- know how to loop over an entire website structure and extract information\n",
    "- know how to save the data afterwards\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For web scraping it is useful to know the basics of html and css, because you have to identifiy the elements of a webpage you want to scrape. The easiest way to locate an element is to open your Chrome dev tools and inspect the element that you need. A cool shortcut for this is to highlight the element you want with your mouse and then press Ctrl + Shift + C or on macOS Cmd + Shift + C instead of having to right click + inspect each time (same in mozilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locating Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "For locating an element on a website you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tag name\n",
    "- Class name\n",
    "- IDs\n",
    "- XPath\n",
    "- CSS selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](./images/html_elements.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "XPath is a technology that uses path expressions to select nodes or node- sets in an XML document (or in our case an HTML document). [Read here for more information](https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/practical-xpath-for-web-scraping/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is Web Scraping Legal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there’s not a cut-and-dry answer here. Some websites explicitly allow web scraping. Others explicitly forbid it. Many websites don’t offer any clear guidance one way or the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before scraping any website, we should look for a terms and conditions page to see if there are explicit rules about scraping. If there are, we should follow them. If there are not, then it becomes more of a judgement call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, though, that web scraping consumes server resources for the host website. If we’re just scraping one page once, that isn’t going to cause a problem. But if our code is scraping 1,000 pages once every ten minutes, that could quickly get expensive for the website owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in addition to following any and all explicit rules about web scraping posted on the site, it’s also a good idea to follow these best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Scraping Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Never scrape more frequently than you need to.\n",
    "- Consider caching the content you scrape so that it’s only downloaded once.\n",
    "- Build pauses into your code using functions like time.sleep() to keep from overwhelming servers with too many requests too quickly."
