There are many HTML editors or IDEs that offer such a preview out of the box, but did you know that you can also use HTML (to a certain extent) in Markdown files? In this notebook you will find some examples of how HTML affects the design of your Markdown cells. As there are some limitations when it comes to applying different styles, we have prepared the same examples using an online HTML editor called [codepen](https://codepen.io/)."
