Besides the parameter for the amount of clusters `n_clusters` we can also define which initialisation method for placing the initial cluster centroids we want to use. We will use the default value `init=k-means++`, which assures that the centroids get placed as far away form each other as possible mitigating the risk of accidentally splitting a cluster in half. With the third parameter `n_init`, we can control how many times K-Means will be run with different starting position for the centroids.
