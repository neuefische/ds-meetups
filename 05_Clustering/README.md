# Clustering Workshop

This repository contains the material for our meetup workshop "A practical approach to clustering"

This 1.5h workshop is aimed at people who have already gathered first experiences in Python programming and want to get insights on how to cluster unlabeled data with various techniques. We will give a short introduction to the topic of clustering, introduce different algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN or agglomerative clustering and show different ways on how to evaluate their performance.


## Materials
We have added our [presentation](A_practical_approach_to_clustering.pdf) if you would like to revisit it.

The workshop also includes two notebooks. With the links below, you can run them online in Google Colab.

## Requirements
If you want to run these notebooks locally, make sure you're using Python 3.
The required Python libraries that are needed are listed in the [requirements](requirements.txt) file.


## Recording
We will record the event and upload it to our neuefische youtube channel as soon as possible.
