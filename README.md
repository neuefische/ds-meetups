# Neuefische Meetups

This repository contains the material for our meetup workshop **"Revisiting Python Fundamentals" on 2/9/21**

This 2h workshop is aimed at people who have already gathered their first experience in python. Hopefully we can find something beneficial in pythons fundamentals that you don’t normally use because you forgot about or just never knew it existed.
In this workshop we covered three python fundamentals:
- list comprehensions
- the three ways to copy objects in Python
- generators

For each of the topics we have created notebooks, that are stored in this repository. 
Witch the links below, you can quite easily run them online in google colab.

If you want to run them locally on your computer, checkout the requirements.
