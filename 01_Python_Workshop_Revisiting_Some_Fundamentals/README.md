![Python workshop, revisiting some fundamentals](images/Python_fundamentals.jpeg)

This repository contains the material for our meetup workshop **"Revisiting Python Fundamentals" on 2/9/21**

This 2h workshop is aimed at people who have already gathered their first experience in python. Hopefully we can find something beneficial in pythons fundamentals that you donâ€™t normally use because you forgot about or just never knew it existed.
In this workshop we covered three python fundamentals:

- list comprehensions
- the three ways to copy objects in Python
- generators

## Materials

We have added our [Revisit Python Fundamentals Presentation](Presentation_Revisit_Python_Fundamentals.pdf) if you would like to revisit it.

For each of the topics we have also created notebooks, that are stored in this repository.
With the links below, you can quite easily run them online in google colab.

If you want to run them locally on your computer, checkout the requirements.
